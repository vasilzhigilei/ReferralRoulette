# ReferralRoulette
I built this during college, and it helped me get my 1st job at Cloudflare. The service no longer exists, but the website is still viewable via the way-back machine. https://web.archive.org/web/20211016185119/https://referralroulette.com/

The idea was that people could enter their referral codes/links into ReferralRoulette, and then visitors seeking referral codes/links would get a random user's referral link. This was supposed to be a better alternative to looking up "uber eats referral code reddit", and primarily the top upvoted commentors on a handful of Reddit posts getting all the referral link uses.
